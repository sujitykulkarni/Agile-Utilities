## Analogy
Altassian's JIRA is a popular project management tool that provides numerous utilities such as effort logging, bug tracking, performance reporting and what not.

JIRA tracks time in its typical '1d 2h 3m' fashion of time tracking. At times, a total of your time spent on number of tasks/bugs is required (by your manager, mostly!). And, this utility will help make life easy on that part.
